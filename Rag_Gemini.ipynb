            "\n",
            "1. **عدم تحديد مصدر المستندات:** يتم إدراج الأرقام والمبالغ دون الإشارة إلى المستندات القانونية الداعمة لها (مثل رقم الفاتورة، رقم العقد، سند القبض، كشف الحساب المصرفي). البيانات الخام بلا مرجع موثق تعتبر مجرد ادعاءات مالية.\n",
            "2. **غياب التوقيع والاعتماد:** لا يوجد ما يدل على الجهة التي أعدت التقرير أو الشخص المسؤول الذي قام بالتوقيع عليه واعتماده، مما يفقده صفة الرسمية والمسؤولية.\n",
            "3. **الخلط بين الكيانات القانونية:** يظهر في النص أسماء شركات متقاربة مثل \"ؾماعث ؾٍاي لخضماث جىظيل اإلاباوي ف.ط.م.م\" و \"ؾماعث بؾٍاي لخضماث جىظيل اإلاباوي ف.ط.م.م\". يجب توضيح العلاقة القانونية بين هذه الكيانات (هل هي ذات الشركة مع خطأ مطبعي، أم فروع، أم شركات مستقلة ذات مسؤولية محدودة) وتوثيق اسمها القانوني الكامل ورقم السجل التجاري لكل منها.\n",

            "1. **عدم وجود رؤوس واضحة للجداول:** الجداول (في الأجزاء العلوية والوسطى) تفتقر إلى عناوين واضحة للأعمدة. على سبيل المثال، في قسم الأفراد، يجب تحديد ما إذا كانت الأعمدة تمثل (رصيد مدين، رصيد دائن، الراتب الأساسي، البدلات، المبلغ المستحق أو المسدد).\n",
            "2. **عدم اتساق التواريخ:** هناك خلط في استخدام تنسيقات التواريخ (يوم/شهر/سنة، وشهر/سنة فقط). كما يجب تفسير التواريخ الممتدة لسنوات طويلة (مثل `07-2019` إلى `08-2022`) وتحديد ما إذا كانت تغطي فترة استحقاق أم فترة عقد.\n",
            "3. **وجود تواريخ مستقبلية غير مفسرة:** إدراج تواريخ في المستقبل (مثل 2025 و 2026) في قائمة المطالبات أو الأفراد (مثل `اخمض غىى`)، يجب تفسيره قانونياً (هل هي التزامات آجلة، كفالات، أو تواريخ تجديد عقود؟).\n",

            "2. **وجود قيم صفرية غير مفسرة:** في قائمة الأفراد، تظهر العديد من القيود بقيمة \"0\" في أحد الأعمدة مقابل قيمة مالية في العمود الآخر. يجب توضيح دلالة الصفر (هل هو جزء مدفوع، رصيد سابق، أو لا ينطبق).\n",
            "3. **البيانات الختامية غير المكتملة:** الجملة الختامية في نهاية التقرير: \"املجعي غليه نيمت ؤغماُ مهاوالث ونياهت اؾم الكغيت\" (التي تعني تقريباً: المعتمد عليه قيمة أعمال مقاولات وكتابة اسم الشركة) هي جملة غير واضحة قانونياً ولا تمثل خلاصة أو توصية أو إقراراً رسمياً.\n",
