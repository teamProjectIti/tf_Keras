            "**Explanation:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **`#include <iostream>`:** This line includes the iostream header file, which provides input and output functionalities in C++.  Think of it as importing the necessary library for using `cout`.\n",
            "* **`int main() { ... }`:**  This is the main function, where the program execution begins.  Every C++ program must have a `main` function.\n",
            "* **`std::cout << \"Hello\" << std::endl;`:** This is the core of the equivalent `print('Hello')` statement.\n",
            "    * **`std::cout`:** This is the standard output stream object in C++.  It's used to display output to the console (usually your terminal).  `std` is the standard namespace.\n",
            "    * **`<<`:** This is the insertion operator.  It's used to \"insert\" data into the output stream.  In this case, it inserts the string \"Hello\" into `std::cout`.\n",
            "    * **`\"Hello\"`:** This is a string literal, representing the text you want to display.\n",
            "    * **`std::endl`:** This is a manipulator that inserts a newline character (`\\n`) into the output stream and also flushes the stream (ensuring the output is immediately displayed).  It's similar to adding `\\n` to the end of the string, but `std::endl` is generally preferred for its stream-flushing behavior.\n",
            "* **`return 0;`:** This statement indicates that the program has executed successfully.  The `return 0;` statement in `main` is not strictly required in modern C++, but it's good practice to include it for clarity.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Key Differences from Python's `print()`:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Explicit Header Inclusion:** C++ requires you to explicitly include the iostream header file to use input/output functions. Python handles imports more implicitly.\n",
            "* **Output Stream:** C++ uses an output stream (`std::cout`) to send output to the console.\n",
            "* **Insertion Operator:**  The `<<` operator is used to insert data into the output stream. Python uses a function call (`print()`).\n",
            "* **Namespaces:**  C++ uses namespaces (like `std`) to organize code and avoid naming conflicts.  You often need to specify the namespace when using standard library elements (e.g., `std::cout`, `std::endl`).\n",
            "* **Semicolons:** C++ statements generally end with semicolons (`;`).  Python doesn't require semicolons at the end of statements.\n",

            "**How to compile and run the C++ code:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Save the code:** Save the code in a file named `hello.cpp` (or any other name with the `.cpp` extension).\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Compile the code:** Open a terminal or command prompt and use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the code.  For example:\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```bash\n",
            "   g++ hello.cpp -o hello\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "   * `g++` is the GNU C++ compiler.\n",
            "   * `hello.cpp` is the name of your source code file.\n",
            "   * `-o hello` tells the compiler to create an executable file named `hello`.\n",
